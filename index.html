      <p>Last year I watched this movie for the first time with my mom. It's a very sad movie and I was crying while watching it, however it was really good. Over break I watched it only again. It's about a young single mom with her daughter living in a hotel. They get seperated from eachother.</p>

        <p>When I was in elementary school i used to love all the Raina Telgimier books. Smile was one of my favorites because it was an interesting and intriguing story for me at the time. The pictures were good and I also enjoyed all the other books. Although I was young when I read it I feel like I would still enjoy reading it even now. Raina Telgimier is a great author for young readers.  </p>
